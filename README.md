## Introduction

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The goal is to fill a 9Ã—9 grid with digits such that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3Ã—3 sub-grids contain all the digits from 1 to 9. This project implements a **Sudoku Solver** using a pipeline that integrates image processing, machine learning, and backtracking algorithms.

## Algorithm Overview

The implemented Sudoku Solver pipeline includes:

1. **Image Processing with OpenCV**:
   - Extract the Sudoku grid from an input image.
   - Perform perspective transformation and preprocessing to enhance grid visibility.

2. **Digit Recognition with CNN**:
   - Predict digits in each cell of the extracted grid.
   - Handle empty cells appropriately.

3. **Backtracking Algorithm**:
   - Solve the recognized grid using recursive backtracking, ensuring that the solution follows Sudoku rules.

4. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Enable users to upload images and view results interactively through the ReactJS-based frontend.
